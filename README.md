# Exploratory Data Analysis - Week 1
## Project from week 1 of the exploratory data analysis course, part of the Data Science track on Coursera

### Instructions
The repo contains 8 files, 4 R files for creating plots and 4 plots that are the outputs of the R code, all plots are created using the base graphics interface are produced as .png files 480x480 pixels in size.  

Each ```plot*.R``` file can be run independently and will download and access the relevant data if not already stored in your working directory.  Alternatively you can place all the ```plot*.R``` files in your working directory and run the following code to replicate the total output of the repo in your own working directory:
```
files <- list.files(pattern = "plot..R"); lapply(files, function(x){source(x)})
```
# The output plots look like this:
